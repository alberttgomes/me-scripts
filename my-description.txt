Hi, this is my analytics while learn Scripts and Shell.

About: 
    1 - multiple comands: 
        cd/; ls -l - to write without need press enter. Use '/;' for separator the comands.

Step By Step:
    1 - Create a file, example `myscript.sh`.

    2 - To specify what shell it will be used in first line of the file.
        example `#!/bin/bash`.

    3 - The symbol # represent line of coments, except on the first line of the  
        file, where the combination indicates the shell that will run the script.
    
    4 - Then is required give permission of execution to script.
        Run: `chmod a+x myscript.sh

Rdirect command output to variables.
Using backticks (``) allow you to assingn the output of a shell
command to a variable. The entire command must be between backticks.
    Example: `day=`date``
